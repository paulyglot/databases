2.Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

Answer: databases are used when you want to add new things to a pre-existing one, and not have the data simply exist in memory on the computer. Additionally, databases are used so that multiple users from different locations can access, edit, manipulate data on their own through a db interface.

3.Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

Answer: SQL is declarative meaning we tell the db what we're looking for and the db engine determines the most efficient way to return the data. Other programming languages that differ from a db language are procedural, meaning we would be defining the algorith for how the database should search.

4.In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

Answer: Structued Query Level db's use tables and columns to organize data. Where the columns are rows meet at each point represent cells, and each cell has value-some pieces of information that the column name describes. Rows make up a complete conceptual unit, and the power of databases lie in the ability to query and manipulate the data. Using declarative statements to select columns, from specific tables at specific rows, we can access data and manipulate.

5.Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

Answer: table - madeup of columns are rows that is the structure which contains all of the organized data. Columns - define what the data represents, Rows - make up a complete conceptual unit, value - is the 'cell' which contains a particular value-some piece of information which lies at the mergence point of each column and row.
